# NearWatch 🍿

**Distance. Deleted.**

## 📖 The Story

This project was born out of frustration.

I am in a long-distance relationship, and my friends are scattered across different cities. Like many people, we tried to keep our movie nights alive using standard tools like Discord, Zoom, or Google Meet.

**The experience was awful.**

* **The Lag:** "Wait, did you see that?" "No, I'm 5 seconds behind."
* **The Quality:** The stream would pixelate into a blurry mess during action scenes.
* **The Desync:** Hearing them laugh at a joke that hadn't happened on my screen yet completely ruined the immersion.

I realized that **conference tools are built for static slides and talking heads, not 24fps high-bitrate cinema.** I didn't want to just *screenshare*; I wanted to *watch together*.

As a UI/UX designer and developer, I couldn't handle the friction anymore. I wanted a platform that prioritized video synchronization above all else. I wanted to replicate the feeling of sitting on the same couch, even when we were miles apart.

So, I built **NearWatch**.
